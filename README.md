 Hidden Markov Mode used to tag parts of speech in English sentences.


## Introduction

Today hidden Markov models have been used for speech recognition and speech generation, machine translation, gene recognition for bioinformatics, and human gesture recognition for computer vision, and more. This is my assignment of Udacity AI course for speech tagging.

## Getting Started

Depending on your system settings, Jupyter will either open a browser window, or the terminal will print a URL with a security token. If the terminal prints a URL, simply copy the URL and paste it into a browser window to load the Jupyter browser. Once you load the Jupyter browser, select the project notebook (HMM tagger.ipynb).
